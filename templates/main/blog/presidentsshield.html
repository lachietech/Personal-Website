    <p class="mb-30">Well that is my last year of Presidents Shield done and dusted. </p>
    <p class="mb-30">  With a triple bronze finish for SQ! ðŸ¥‰ðŸ¥‰ðŸ¥‰</p>
    <p class="mb-30">  Over the week long span of bowling I bowled over 32 games including the Australian Junior Masters and Presidents Shield and averaged out at 190 for the whole event. Even though Masters did not go to plan.</p>
    <p class="mb-30">  Super stoked with how we went as a team, the dynamic was magical and there was a massive shift in energy from the previous years. Through days of screaming till your voice went numb and slamming high 5s till your hands got bruised. It's safe to say that it was an amazing time with a great group of people.</p>
    <p class="mb-30">  I would like to take the time to thank the South Queensland committee, Gail Torrens, Gio Mison, Jodi Bishop, Rob McDonald, Nathan Stein, and who could forget Jo and Tamika Pettigrew for your tireless efforts and behind the scenes work in making this event what it was. It goes a really long way and it seriously doesn't get recognised enough how much effort goes into making these things happen. </p>
    <p class="mb-30">  To my coaches and ball reps for this event Troy Piffero, Gail Torrens, and Ray Trenham. I seriously cannot thank you guys enough for all the time and work you put in with me over this week, whether it was lane adjustments, Surface and ball change work, chats, or telling me to take the handbag off my shoulder (Yes Troy I did leave it on the chair this time). The efforts you have put in have seriously helped shape my shot over the years I have had the pleasure of working with you, and I would really like to thank you all personally for doing so. </p>
    <p class="mb-30">  Lastly to all my team mates. The boys Tyler Clarkson, Samuel Kubik, Levi Greenhill, Chris Quinnlivan, and Will Mison. And the girls Chloe Piffero, Ella Hoffmann, Charlotte Elizabeth, Bella Westlake, Bee Kyte, Mia Murrell. I hope that you all continue with what you are doing. And i hope to see your names on future trophies of President's Shield for years to come. You all have massive potential. And I hope you all ride that until the world takes you all to greatness. Work hard, stay strong, and believe just as I do that you all have what it takes to get there. </p>
    <p class="mb-30">  And of course a massive thank you to the sponsors: 
    <p class="mb-30">  Michael Phipps with NDISmate
    <p class="mb-30">  And Kenneth Nielsen and Kathy Nielsen with Special K'S opal</p>
